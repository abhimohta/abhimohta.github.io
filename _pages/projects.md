* **Neural-Guided Deductive Search for Real-Time Program Synthesis**  
 *Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Lab India Pvt. Ltd.*  
 Guide: [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/), Researcher, Microsoft Research Lab India  
 *Working on enhancing the Program Synthesis by Example(PROSE) framework by replacing hand-written heuristics with machine-learnt models. Using Deep Learning to prune unnecessary branches in the synthesis process of program generation. Have come up with NGDS - a hybrid technique that combines symbolic logic techniques and statistical models to reduce branch exploration by over 50% and gain speed up of over 10x in important benchmarks.*  
 *Patent filed and research paper in review for the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2018.*

**Research/Industry projects**
* **Neural-Guided Deductive Search for Real-Time Program Synthesis from Examples**  
 *Research Fellow at Microsoft Research Lab India Pvt. Ltd.*  
 Guide: [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/)  
 *Implemented NGDS - a hybrid technique that combines symbolic logic techniques and statistical models to reduce branch exploration in PROSE by over 50% and gain speed up of over 10x in important benchmarks.*  
 *Patent filed and research paper accepted as a conference paper at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2018.*  
 For more details about PROSE, please check this [page](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/).        
* **Static Module Verifier Automation**  
 *Research Intern at Microsoft Research Lab India Pvt. Ltd.*  
 Guide: [Dr. Rahul Kumar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahulku/), [Dr. Bharat M. Deshpande](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/bmd/profile)  
 *As a part of my undergraduation thesis at MSR, enabled Whole Program analysis as a Service. Successfully ran SMV on the entire Windows drivers code base and found 350+ null-pointer and use-after-free bugs.*  
 For more details about SMV, please check this [page](https://github.com/Microsoft/Static-Module-Verifier).    
* **Automated Content Correction and Validation Engine**  
 *Software Development Engineering Intern, Amazon Development Centre India Pvt. Ltd*  
 *Worked on adding features and improving the automated content correction and validation engine in the Amazon retail pipeline. Also worked on implementing the infrastructure for a feedback system to reduce manual intervention using AWS tools.*  
* **New-entity extraction from Bing query logs**  
 *Machine Learning Intern, Microsoft India Development Center*  
 Guide: [Narayanan Subramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narayanan-subramanian-1772802/)  
 *Implemented a classifier to find new/missing restaurants in the Bing database levaraging user query logs. Achieved accuracy of over 90%.*  
* **Open-sourcing remote-sensing software ERDAS**  
 *Intern, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun  
 *Implemented a tool to process satellite images and open-sourced the commonly used remote sensing software ERDAS. As a part of the project, we implemented several machine learning algorithms â€“ SVM, K-means, etc. using which we were trying to build the various features of the software like vegetation mapping and cloud cover. (Team of 6)  
  
**Course projects/Initiatives**  
  
* Implemented the malloc/calloc/free function, a proxy server with cache, a linux shell (tsh-tiny shell) and a generic cache simulator from scratch. [Code available on request] (Introduction to Computer Systems (15-513), CMU)  
* **Clustering closely-related terrorist attacks leveraging the Global Terrorism database (Data Mining, BITS Pilani)**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/Clustering-on-Global-Terrorism-Database)  
*Mined the data in the Global Terrorism database and analysed it using optimized K-means algorithm using Hadoop and Java.*  
* **Centralized management portal for family business**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/Centralized-Management-Portal-for-Factories)  
 *Implemented a management portal for my fathers' business - to centrally handle multiple factories and orders. Developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL.*  
* **Co-Founder, Xinger - a fully automated online food ordering portal**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/Restaurant-Aggregating-Portal)  
 *Developed the complete portal in a short span of 2 days and negotiated and closed deals with over 20 restaurants. The startup had a client base of over 7000 and generated over $25,000 revenue in the 2 years of operation.*  
* **Development of BITS Pilani Goa main gate security system**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/Main-Gate-Security-System)  
* **Designed a VLIW pipelined processor for a given set of instructions (Computer Architecture, BITS Pilani)**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/VLIW-Processor)  
* **Designed a Write Through, FIFO, Way Prediction cache of 512B with associativity 2 (Computer Architecture, BITS Pilani)**  
 [Source code](https://github.com/abhimohta/Cache-Design)  
* **Designed a microprocessor based flour packing machine on Proteus programmed in assembly language (Microprocessors and Interfacing, BITS Pilani)** 
* **Developed a stand-alone mess management software in Java using JDBC and MySQL**

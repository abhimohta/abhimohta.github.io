I'm currently working as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India under Dr. Prateek Jain. In the current project, I am exploring the application of Deep Learning to the domain of Program Synthesis. In the past, I have worked in the fields of Machine Learning and Systems at my various internships at Microsoft Research, Amazon, Microsoft IDC and IIRS.  
  
I graduated with distinction from BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus with a dual degree in Economics and Computer Science. During college days I had worked on a number of projects in web development, machine learning, data mining and software engineering as well.  
  
Apart from computers and software, I love meeting new people, public speaking, event management and leading teams in general. Apart from being an active debater and participant in Model United Nations in the past, I have had a food delivery startup of my own along with a team of 5, that ran successfully for over 2 years. Also, I led a team of over 300 students and successfully organised [Waves](https://www.facebook.com/bitswaves/) 2014, the annual cultural festival of my college.
